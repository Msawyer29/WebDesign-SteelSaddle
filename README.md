# WebDesign-SteelSaddle
For my WebDesign project I created a website for the Montreal based band Steel Saddle.

The website contains a home/index with a video player showing their latest video on YouTube.
The site also has links to social media and streaming services at the bottom of every page.
Other pages include: music, merch, tour and a contact page.

The contact page uses EmailJS to submit messages via the "Contact Us" form. Users can send a message which will successfully deliver to the band's email and upon a successful submission the user receives a success message.
